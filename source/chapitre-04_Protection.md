# Méthodes de protection

Up to now → procedural programming (simply applying code and inserting information into a database) 

	Escape the code → only see as text 
 [  mysqli_real_escape_string( “link parameter”, “input”)  ]
 
	Never insert a text (input) directly into a database, as It could be code
